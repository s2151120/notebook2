Understanding how guilds worked:

Association of skilled members who trained via apprenticeships. 

Closed and had a monopoly over a certain good. For example, the blacksmith guild of Peckham where citizens of Peckham only bought tools from that particular guild. Issue with guilds is that they did not keep up with growing demand and population due to their closed system. 

The divison of labour of guilds took place as follows:
Every person in a particular guild had more or less the same job.
However, guilds would team up with other guilds and combine their efforts to produce a good. So, the division of labour did not occur within a single workshop but over guilds as a whole. One guild would do one thing, another guild would do something else.

Guilds were replaced with the middle class manufacturers. 

Alongside this, the division of labour did not occur over separate guilds but over a single workshop. 

Then the demand kept rising and manufacturers could not keep up so industry was invented.
