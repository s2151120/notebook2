> "The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie" - Communist Manifesto

Burghers were artisans who owned the means of production and also the result of production (blacksmiths, butchers, bakers etc.) and were situated between the lords and the serfs. 

The discovery of America gave new opportunities for the middle class because it stimulated markets to new heights (commerce, navigation, industry) which facilitated the polarization of society into two camps: working class and capitalists. 

[[How did guilds work?]]

The middle class's existence is also mainly due to the industrial revolution and the surpassing of guild-masters and manufacturers with industrialists. As industrialists met the every increasing demand set by colonial markets, they accumulated vast profits and capital. 

The good thing about the industrialists is that they put an end to feudalism because feudal modes of production were no longer viable.
