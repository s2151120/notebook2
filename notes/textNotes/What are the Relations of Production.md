What is a social relation? It is the connection between two people. 
They come in 2 types: voluntary and involuntary.

For example, I freely associate with Zack and the social relation that exists between us is friendship. This is a voluntary social relation.

I am bound to my mum and the social relation that exists between us is familial. This is an involuntary social relation, defined by my existence. 

Relations of production refer to the involuntary social relations that people enter in order to survive, reproduce and produce. 

The sum of all the relations of production are part of the [[Mode of Production]]

[[Relations of Production and Power]]
