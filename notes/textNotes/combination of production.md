grouping a series of branches into one big enterprise:

smelting of iron ore to pig-iron -> converting pig-iron to steel -> manufacturing steel goods.

Each step usually has a specific company dedicated to it, but sometimes a single enterprise would own every branch.

In doing so, the final good can be sold at a cheaper price while maintaining profits therefore upholding [[monopoly]].
