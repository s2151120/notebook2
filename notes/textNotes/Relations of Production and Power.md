Under [[What are the Relations of Production]], we established that the relations of production are necessarily involuntary. We also know that capitalists control the mode of production. So, relations of productions are actually the basis of power in capitalist societies. Capitalists can dismiss any worker at will, workers are at the mercy of capitalists. Therefore, by studying the relations of productions of a capitalist nation, we are also directly studying the relations of power. 

What does Marx mean when he says:

>"The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society." - Communist Manifesto

Well we know that the instruments of production refer to machinery and capital. By changing the production process to increase productivity, we are displacing workers and changing the relations of production and therefore changing the relations of production. 

To prove that the relations of production are power structures, we need to understand [[capitalist crises]]. When production becomes too much, the working class become at the mercy of the capitalists, who frequently lay off the working class during periods of 'bust' in the [[business cycle]].
