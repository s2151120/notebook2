Banks and loans are subject to the free market much like producers and goods. There is both a supply and demand, where the supply is the savings and the demand is the investment. 

The price of loans is the interest rate you pay which is where the bank makes its profits.

If the bank becomes monopolized, companies are at the mercy of interest rates set by the bank.

So, under the conditions of a free market, banks and industries tend towards monopolization. Also under a free market, finance capital becomes the dominant form of capital.
