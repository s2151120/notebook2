Debt can be used as money.  
Bank run = event where people try get their money out of their banks but banks don't have it.

So banks wanted to create a new type of money. One that is not physical. 

1704: Promissory Note = a written promise to pay back an X amount of dollars. This is basically debt and equivalent to physical money.
