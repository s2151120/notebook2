Imagine we are making a pencil. Let's say a pencil consists of a wooden shaft with a lead pipe and a rubber held in place with a brass clip.

Imagine all the processes needed to take the timber, lead, copper and zinc to make the final project. Each process requires at least one individual giving some of their labour power. 

The involvement of many individuals pooling their labour power to create a produt is the socialization of production described by Lenin's Imperialism.
