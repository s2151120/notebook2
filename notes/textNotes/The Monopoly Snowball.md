Let's say that a monopoly already has a certain amount of power. Then it accrues that power even more by forcing smaller enterprises to submit to them. They do this in 8 ways:

1) stopping the flow of raw materials (because they usually own the raw material deposits)
2) contracts with trade unions to only work with monopolized enterprises
3) contracts with buyers to only buy with monopolized enterprises
4) boycott
5) closing trade outlets
6) stopping deliveries 
7) systematic price cutting
8) stopping credits
