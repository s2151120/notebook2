AKA a [[monopoly]].

[[Socialization (Marxism)]] occurs when production becomes concentrated and more and more people are pooling their labour to create products.

Assume however, that every individual creates and sells their own product. They own the means of production as well as the results of production. Then any surplus they make is theirs to keep. As well as this, they have complete say in the mode of production because they ARE the sole employer and employee. 

Now, thinking of a large enterprise, they have lots and lots of people pooling their labour power but these labourers have no say in the matter and do not keep the surpluses of production. 

This is a [[Marxist contradiction]].
