The considerations of someone purchasing a compimentary good as well as a farmer producing goods in joint supply are very similar. 

For consumers, cheaper is better and for producers expensive is better.

In the case of the consumer as mentioned in [[Types of goods in relation to one another]], we see that if one good and another good are somehow connected (like a left pair and right pair of shoes), we say that the complimentary effect takes place (that is to say both goods are equally affected by the demand of one good on another).

Profitiability of other goods is similar sort of...

If one good goes up then the supply would buy more of a particular type of capital that is used to make said good. If another type of good is made with utilising a distinct part of the same unit of capital we can say that these two goods can benefit the producer if they make more of each.
