[[Shape of Marginal Curve and Average Total Cost Curve]]

If $f(x) =$ total cost, $g(x) =$ variable costs and $C =$ fixed costs
then $f(x) = g(x) + C$

Let $g(x) = 14Q^2 + 3Q + 5$

Since marginal cost is the first derivative of average cost, $C_M = 28Q + 3$

And the average total cost, $C_A = (14Q^2 + 3Q + 5)(\frac{1}{Q})$
$C_A = 14Q + 3 + \frac{5}{Q}$

Thinking about a U shape to represent the average total cost. Then, think about a straight upwards sloping line to think about the marginal cost. The average total cost will start at a higher place than the marginal cost so, when $C_A > C_M$ then the average total cost will fall. If the $C_A < C_M$ then the average total cost will rise.
