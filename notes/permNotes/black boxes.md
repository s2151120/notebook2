Not to be confused with black boxes as a metaphor for functions. [[black box]]

A box is something that is self contained. Its blackness is to do with visibility - being hidden or wrapped up. 
So if a module is described as a black box, it should be entirely contained with all the code being rendered invisible to the engineer. Its boxiness is synonymous with its ability to be extracted neatly and without mess from a piece of code and to be replaced with another black box.
