Feminists criticize the [[marginal product theory of distribution]] especially the [[trade-off between consumption and leisure]] where if consumption was assumed to be pleasurable than so is leisure (which is defined as non-work). The trade-off between the two helps to determine the supply of labour. However women involve themselves in childcare and domestic jobs that are certainly not leisure, but are also not considered productive work despite benefiting society economically and in terms of welfare. 

Ultimately, neo-classical theories of models don't take into account power. The assumption is that the labourer and capitalist have a mutually beneficial relationship. However the existence of power would mean that one would benefit more out of the market interaction than the other. 

The neo-classical theory therefore does not encapsulate enough nuance on power structures and makes vast over-simplifications on the equality of opportunity.
