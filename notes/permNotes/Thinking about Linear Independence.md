It is very intuitive to envisage linear independence geometrically. To be dependent is to not have your existence defined by others.  ([[Independence in a political sense and a mathematical sense]])Converting this to algebra:

Let's take two vectors in 3d space:
$<a,b,c>, <i,j,k>$. If they are not linearly dependent, then there can't be some scalars $<k_1, k_2, k_3>$ and $k_4, k_5, k_6>$ such that $<ak_1, bk_2, ck_3> = <ik_4, jk_5, kk_6>$ unless $<k_1, k_2, k_3> = <k_4, k_5, k_6> = 0$ Since these equations are effectively linear combinations, we can write them in linear combination style:

$ak_1 + bk_2 + ck_3 = ak_4 + bk_5 + ck_6$

$(k_1-k_4)a + (k_2-k_5)b + (k_3-k_6)c = 0$
