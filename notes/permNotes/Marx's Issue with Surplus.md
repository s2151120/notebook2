Originally, societies were subsistence based. Meaning, labour was at the bare minimum for survival and all that was produced was immediately consumed. The absence of surplus = the absence of exchange = the absence of a market (?).

Anyway, the development of productivity meant that people produced more than they needed creating a surplus. 

Marx's issue was that the surplus was taken by the ruling classes who did not actually contribute to the labour to earn it. If the ruling class take the surplus then the workers don't have anything in exchange (feudalism/slavery).
