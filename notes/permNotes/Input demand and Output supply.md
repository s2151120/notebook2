Input demand is the demand for inputs of production i.e labour.
Output supply is the amount of goods that people produce.

Demand is linked with marginal benefit, output supply is linked with marginal cost. Therefore, we have to investigate marginal benefit and marginal cost in relation to input demand and output supply. 

Since this is from the perspective of an employer, the marginal benefit to something would be the amount of money the employer gains while the marginal cost will be the amount that the employer pays.

So: if an employer pays for one extra employee, whose wage is $500, then the marginal cost was $500.

If the employee can bring home 50 extra apples, each 1 dollar per apple then the marginal product is $50. By dividing the marginal benefit by the marginal product we get the marginal cost, which is the cost to increase the total quantity of products by one unit, 500/50, $10.

If a firm was to profit-maximize then the marginal cost = marginal benefit.
Marginal costs and benefits are relative to what the marginal unit is. So we could be talking about another unit of input or another unit of output. Let's say we're talking about another unit of input. Then the marginal cost would be the wage, and the marginal benefit would be the value of the marginal product. Therefore:

$W = P \times M_p$
Where:
$W =$ wage
$P =$ market price
$M_p =$ marginal product

$P = M_c$
