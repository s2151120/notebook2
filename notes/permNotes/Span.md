Span can be thought of as the reach of a set of vectors.

A matrix $M$ looks like:
$\begin{bmatrix}
a_11 & a_12 & \cdots & a_1n \\
a_21 & a_22 & \cdots & a_2n \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_n1 & a_n2 & \cdots & a_nn
\end{bmatrix}$

can be split up by columns to form $n$ vectors of $n$ length. Iff these vectors are non parallel, the span of these vectors cover $n$ dimensions. Number of vectors - Number of linearly dependent vectors + 1 = Number of dimensions covered perhaps?
