Resources are limited. If a company is not being efficient with its resources then it is necessary that it fails so that a more efficient company can take over and put those limited resources to better use. 

Some components of market efficiency include: 
1.  [[functioning of output markets]]
2.  [[financial systems]]
3.  [[labor markets]]

Foreign trade incentivises the most productive businesses to stay productive while punishing the less productive businesses thus helping with the allocation of resources.  

### Quality of the [[Regulatory Framework]]

Regulatory framework can be seen as a hindrance. If a country has a poor regulatory framework, that means that there is either so many barriers to entry that it would be too cumbersome to even try or (in the case of a complete lack of a regulatory framework) that basic rights such as property rights would not be respected therefore it is too risky to enter the market. 

[[Education]] and [[Innovation]] do have a part to play with regards to regulatory frameworks.
