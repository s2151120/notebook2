If goods are outputs and capital are inputs, we usually define production to be the function as we did in [[input market]] and [[functioning of output markets]] where we likened them to a [[black box]]. 

[[The link between goods in joint supply and complimentary goods]]

Functions are, by definition many-to-one or one-to-one mappings. When considering the production of goods in joint supply, it is more useful to think of production as a *relation* rather than a *function* to allow for the possibility of many-to-many or one-to-many mappings.

In this case, the production of goods takes multiple (or singular) inputs (multiple types of capital) and gives multiple outputs (multiple goods).

Classic example:

$\{cows \rightarrow (milk, leather)\}$

If the price of one good increases, the supply of the other good increases.
