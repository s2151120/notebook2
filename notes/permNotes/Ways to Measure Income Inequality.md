Why is measuring inequality not necessarily accurate?

People earn different amounts at different stages of their lives, therefore if countries have different population structures, then that would distort the analysis. This is called the life cycle. Therefore the standard of living of a person in a certain year depends more on lifetime income than on income in that year. 

Transitory vs Permanent Income: permanent income is the smoothed out consumption of income. Transitory income is the changes in income in that specific year.
