Lets say a footballer earned £300k. Then his pay was cut to £120k would he still be a footballer? The minimum wage to be a footballer is defined as his transfer earnings. And the difference between his current salary and his transfer earnings is his economic rent.

Economic rent is a more general concept relating to producers that sell services.
