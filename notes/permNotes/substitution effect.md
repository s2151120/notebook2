Say for example I offer you milk and I offer you orange juice to drink for breakfast. Milk is more expensive than orange juice so you choose orange juice.

However, if the price of milk falls to below orange juice then you would pick milk. Therefore, when the price of a good falls, it is more appealing than its substitutes. Therefore less people would buy substitutes and more people will buy the cheaper good thus increasing demand. 

The dynamic of the demand of milk vs the demand of orange juice gives insight into what types of goods these are in relation to each other. [[Types of goods in relation to one another]]
