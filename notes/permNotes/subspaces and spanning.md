[[Defintion of Subspace of R^n]]

A subspace is closed under addition and closed under multiplication. 

The set can be thought of as a box and everything that is not in the subspace is outside while everything that is is inside. If the box is closed under multiplication that means multiplication with a real number keeps the content of the box inside. Same with addition. Therefore sets and subspace can be visualized as boxes.
