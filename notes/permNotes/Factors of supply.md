Looking at the quantity supplied as a function of supply with the inputs: 

1. [[profitability of other goods in production and prices of goods in joint supply]]
2. [[technology]]
3. natural and social factors
4. prices of the factors of production
	1. related to [[Market Efficiency]]
5. expectation of producers
	1. much like expectations of consumers in [[Factors of supply]]
6. number of sellers
	1. since the total market supply is the aggregation of individual sellers much like [[Size and Structure of Population]] with regards to demand

Expanding on this, the factors of supply and the [[Determinants of Productivity]] share many similarities. [[Determinants of Productivity]] implies an increased total [[Supply]] but the same cannot be said the other way round. 

`productivity` $\implies$ `supply`
`supply`$\centernot\implies$`productivity`
