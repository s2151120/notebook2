Leisure = satisfaction gained from not working
Consumption = satisfaction gained from spending money that you earned from working.

We can see leisure and consumption as two goods.

If we earned $50 an hour, and we are awake for 16 hours in a day, we can choose to spend those 16 hours relaxing, working or some combination of the two. Each combination we can call a 'bundle'. The budget constraint would be a straight line between the two axes. Indifference curves would be bundles of consumption and leisure that provide equal utility. 

The optimum point would be when the budget constraint runs tangent to an indifference curve. 

When we are just consuming, we eventually become sick of it and want to give up a lot just for a small amount of leisure. Vice versa therefore the curve slopes downwards.

[[income effect]] and [[substitution effect]] determines the fate of increasing wages. 

If you increase your wage there is either:

-> increase in leisure time because you can have more leisure time and still be equally well off [[income effect]]

-> increase in consumption because the opportunity cost for leisure increases so you substitute it for consumption [[substitution effect]]
