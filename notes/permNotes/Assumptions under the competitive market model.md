Defining [[the Market]]

1. Many buyers and sellers in the market.
2. No individual buyer and seller is big enough or has the power to influence the price.
3. Goods produced are identical.
4. Freedom of entry and exit to the market.
5. Buyers and sellers are independent and selfish.
6. Clearly defined property rights.

If these assumptions are true, the output is an efficient allocation of resources. [[Market Efficiency]].

The model of the competitive market is used as a basis for the [[marginal product theory of distribution]]
