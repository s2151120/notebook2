We have a market which is made up of a group of people that earn $x$ amount in a year.

We have a good that they want to buy. The price of the milk drops from $y_0$ to $y$  but their incomes stay the same.

Since these people are agents who seek to efficiently allocate their income in a way that brings them the most pleasure, $x - y_0 > x - y$ and therefore more people will want to buy the good. Thus the demand increases.

[[What is the difference between income as a factor and the income effect?]]
