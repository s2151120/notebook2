[[Income]] as a factor vs [[income effect]].

They are actually the reverse of one another.

They both explain demand through the interplay of three variables: the price of a good, the demand and income levels.

Considering demand as a function that takes two inputs: income of individuals and price of a good.

[[Income]] as a factor examines the function when income is a variable and price of a good is fixed.

[[income effect]] examines the function when income is fixed and price of a good is variable.
