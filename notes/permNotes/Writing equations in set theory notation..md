Let's say $ax + by + cz = 0$ represents some plane $M$ that goes through the origin. 

Then $n = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$ is the normal to the plane. 

$M = \{v \in \mathbb{R}^3 | n  \cdot v = 0\}$

$v = \begin{bmatrix} x\\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$

Links to [[Computational Logic]] in terms of list comprehension. Every $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is passed through and tested with the clause $n \cdot v = 0$ and all the true ones are returned to form the plane $M$.
