A production function takes the quantity of labour as input and outputs the number of goods produced.

The tendency is that, as more and more workers are introduced, the production function gets flatter and flatter due to the diminishing marginal benefit of having more and more workers in a space.

Profit = worker contribution to revenue (minus) wage
