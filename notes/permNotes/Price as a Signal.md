The price of a good sends signals to consumers and producers.

Producer sees that the price of a good is rising: sign to increase production because they can sell whatever they produce.

Consumer sees that price of a good is rising: they have to sacrifice more to acquire the good

The price of a good is determined by the interplay between [[Supply]] and [[Demand]] in the sense of [[Analysing supply and demand together]]

The total revenue of a market is $P \times Q_s$
Where $P =$ price of a good and $Q_s =$ quantity supplied.
