Recalling from A Level maths:


![[graph shift left 1.gif]]

Graph shifts to the *left* if we apply $f(x+n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n > 0$. 

Graph shifts to the *right* if we apply $f(x-n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n >0$.

Generally, we think of the place of positive and negative numbers in a number line and then flip our intuition. A left movement is associated with negative numbers so we flip our intuition and associate it with positive numbers. So, when thinking about left shifts, think about adding and when thinking about right shifts, think about subtracting. 

So in a demand or a supply curve, the graph shifts to the left if the (quantity/supply) increases, and the graph shifts to the right if the (quantity/supply). 

Let's look at the graph $y = x$ and the graph $y_0 = x-1$ in the positive quadrant. Then, given the same $x$,  $y_0 < y$. Therefore, a shift to the right decreases the output if the graph is sloping upwards. Vice versa for a left shift.

Now considering a graph $y = -x$ and the graph $y_0 = -x-1$ in the (negative $x$, positive $y$) quadrant. Then given the same $x$, $y_0 > y$. Therefore a shift to the right increases the output if the graph is sloping downwards. Vice versa for left shift.

Ultimately, we can view supply and demand curves as up-sloping and down-sloping curves and apply these rules.
