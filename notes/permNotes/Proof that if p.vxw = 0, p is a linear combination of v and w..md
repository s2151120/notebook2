$M = \{av + bw | a, b \in \mathbb{R} \}$

We know that this describes a plane. The plane can also be described in the form $n.(p - p_0) = 0$. $n$ = $v \times w$ since $v$ and $w$ are non parallel and lie on the plane. 

Since $v \times w$ = $n$, $v \times w \cdot p = n \cdot p = 0$ Therefore, any vector $p$ orthogonal to $v \times w$ lies on the plane $M$. Since $v$ and $w$ are non parallel vectors on the plane $M$, $p$ can be described as a linear combination of $v$ and $w$.
