Usually, the biggest variable that affects demand is price. 

[[The law of Demand]] is very important and explores the relationship between price and demand.

Demand schedule -> table with numbers
Demand curve -> graphed from the demand schedule.

Movements along the curve vs [[shifts on the curve]]:

Movements along the curve occur when every independent variable is fixed apart from price and you analyse the changes made to the dependent variable. The point at which you're in the curve changes but the actual graph as a whole doesn't. 

Shifts on the demand curve occurs when factors other than price affect the market of a good. If the news said there's a gas shortage for example, the demand as a whole for gas would increase at every price point. This is related to [[factors of demand]] 

Shifts on the curve are as a result of the [[factors of demand]]

If we move along a demand curve, the price falls according to[[The law of Demand]]. However, why is this the case?

This happens due to the [[income effect]] as well as the [[substitution effect]].
