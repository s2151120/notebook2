Value of marginal product of input = marginal product of input x market price of output.

Gaining some clarity via example:

When I have one worker in a farm, I produce 1000 apples.
When I have two workers in a farm, I produce 1800 apples.

The marginal product of labour, (the increase in output as a result of marginally increasing input) is equal to 800. Because the output went from 1000 to 1800 by increasing the number of workers by 1. 

That gives the first term of the right hand side. The second term of the right hand side is the market price per something usually. So perhaps 1 dollar per apple. Therefore the *value* of marginal product of input would be $800. In other words, the contribution to your revenue by adding one extra worker is equivalent to the value of the marginal product of labour. 

**The value of the marginal product of labour is AKA the marginal revenue product**
