Linking [[Education]] and [[Regulatory Framework]] we can ask the impact of administrative efficiency on market efficiency, Since [[Education]] is about the employment of [[Innovation]] on a large scale, innovations can be made on the digitisation of financial statements, records displaying property and patents etc. As a result, a good education would result in such ideas being put into wide practice by an institution that would form a regulatory body. This institution would constitute the regulatory framework. By having better administrative efficiency, the positives of having a regulatory framework with regards to property rights and other stuff would be maximised leading to higher [[Market Efficiency]].
