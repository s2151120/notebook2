Lower levels of productivity for decades due to underinvesting.

Ageing population = less labor force but more mouths to feed.

Underinvestment happens primarily in education and human capital: knowledge. 

A **public** way to improve productivity:
Raise wages so that workers are incentivised to work harder. 

If the UK is to seriously improve its productivity it needs to look to the private sector according to van Ark. Links to [[Regulatory Framework]]. A lack of a regulatory framework would drive companies to be more efficient thereby achieving [[Market Efficiency]].
