Firstly, we have to consider, why does the marginal cost rise? This is because as we increase the number of workers, we have to pay them more so the marginal cost curve will always be rising. 

Then we have to consider the shape of the average total cost. Firstly, the average total cost is the sum of the average fixed cost and the average variable cost. As the quantity increases, the fixed cost gets spread out over lots of people so it decreases. Average variable cost rises due to the diminishing marginal product. The first part of the U shape where it is falling downwards represents the average fixed cost decreasing, the second part shows the average variable cost rising.
