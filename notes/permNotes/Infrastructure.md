Infrastructure: infra -> below, so infrastructure refers to the very base components of an economy. Roads, internet, factory buildings, power etc.

Since the productivity of goods can be thought of as [[inputs of production]] vs outputs, we want the inputs to be as cost effective as possible. However when buying an input for your business, you don't only take into account the price of the capital itself but also other expenses bound to infrastructure. For example: taking coal from Fushan to Nanjing would require you to pay for the price of transporting the coal across the railroad either separately or included in the price. Therefore by having good quality infrastructure, businesses can enjoy a steady flow of cheap inputs with minimal costly disruptions thereby maximising productivity. 

It has a connection with [[Regulatory Framework]]. It is necessary that for infrastructure to be efficient it has to be uniform. A regulatory framework ensures that within a nation, the same gauge trains are used, the same air traffic signals are used, the same size pipes are used etc. This may lead to an overarching point on the role of government in determining productivity.
