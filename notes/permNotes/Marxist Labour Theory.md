[[Value in Use vs Value of Exchange]]

Adam Smith: The amount of labour that went into producing a good partly determined its value in exchange.

Ricardo argues another factor: land, determined price of output. 
More productive land = less labourers needed so landowners charged a higher price to rent the land to farmers.

The landlord does nothing to earn the surplus value. 

## Marx's Insight

Socially necessary time = amount of working hours it takes for an averagely skilled labour to produce a good

This means that the price of a good is independent on individual labourers but rather on labourers as a whole.

All goods in a capitalist economy have a price related to their value (exchange) so when considering labour the same way we get:

## Understanding dead labour

Let the production of a good be a function of which there are inputs of production and the output, the aforementioned good. 

Then these multiple inputs have had labour acted on them to become suitable as inputs. The dead labour is the labour required to bring the inputs into existence. The dead labour is also the "natural" labour and extends to raw materials. 

## Moving on to living labour

Which is more about the actual function itself. Since we defined the function to be taking the inputs and forming the output, the living labour is the function itself; it is the process of bringing those inputs and yielding an output - it is the [[black box]]. 

## Recursion // ComSci

The whole idea of living and dead labour is relative. When analysing the production of electrical wire, we say that the production of electrical wire is the living labour and that the inputs of copper and rubber are dead labour. We can then take the reference point of copper. Now considering copper as a good, the extraction of copper as a good is the living labour and the dead labour would be the natural existence of copper? The null state perhaps? Recursion needs a base case.

Therefore the value of the good should reflect the value of the living labour as well as the dead labour in the past.
