The market is an aggregation of transactions. Transactions occur when one party desires one thing, another party desires another thing and a swap takes place. Transactions are equal as they happen out of free will between the parties involved.

Virtually every society has engaged in markets. The history of markets is older than human history: https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-biological-markets/


The allocation of a market in order to maximise its utility is called [[Market Efficiency]]
