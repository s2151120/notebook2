Relative poverty vs Absolute poverty

Poverty rate = % of population at or below the poverty line. 

Problems with poverty: do not take into account household assets and savings. Also does not take into account inescapable costs. If someone earns more but spends all their money looking after their family member, then the amount left over may leave them below the poverty line.
