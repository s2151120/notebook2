WIth regards to [[elasticity]] we can use percentage change to work out the price elasticity given the price and quantity before and after. If we are not given that data, we have to use methods to calculate the point price elasticity.

Price elasticity of demand:

$d_e = \frac{P}{Q_d} \times \frac{dQ_d}{dP}$

In other words, it will be the price / quantity demanded multiplied by the reciprocal of the gradient.
