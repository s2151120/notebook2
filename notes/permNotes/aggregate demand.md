the economy as a whole.
In the x axis, we plot the actual production of the economy (Real GDP) in a given time.
Then in the y axis, we plot the general price levels. So if prices are high, GDP will shrink, when prices are low, GDP will expand. 

Aggregate demand: how much productivity will be in a country as a function of the price levels.
