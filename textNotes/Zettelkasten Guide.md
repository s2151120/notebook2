Two types of notes: text notes and perma notes. Difference between the two are outlined:

## Perma Notes:
* how are these facts relevant to me
* what is my personal interpretation of these facts
* what questions do these facts answer
* notes are context independent
* rephrasing thoughts

## Text Notes:
* facts and theories
* author's interpretation of facts and theories
* rephrasing ideas from text
