When the capitalists face issues, it is because of "overproduction". Thinking about the [[business cycle]], when there is an expansion in economic activity, lots of goods are being produced. Therefore goods are available for cheap. This is excellent for capitalists who can buy capital for cheap to make even more goods and ensue profits. The capitalists then use purchased capital to create even more goods. There reaches a point of overproduction when there are too many goods in the market. Due to a large supply, goods can't be sold as profitably anymore so the rate of profit declines.

Due to the rate of profit declining, businesses have to be shut down and workers have to be fired.
