Labour power is an essential resource that drives production.

Capitalism organises the supply of labour power through [[the Market]]. Under [[Assumptions under the competitive market model]], markets require free entry and exit, therefore under capitalism it is necessary for people to choose to sell their own labour or not.

These agents are only formally free (formally as in nominally) to enter the market, because if they don't then restitution awaits them.

The existence of a Labour market is not time immemorial. The Classic institution (as in the institution of slavery during the Classic era) of slavery meant that you didn't sell your labour, you were owned by masters.
