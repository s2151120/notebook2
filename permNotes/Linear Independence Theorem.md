### Formal definition:
If $\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\}$ is an independent set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then every vector in span $\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\}$ has a **unique** representation as a linear combination of the $x_i$.

### Informal definition:
A linear combination disappears when it equals the zero vector and it is trivial when the constants are zero. Therefore, a set of vectors is independent if and only if the only linear combination that vanishes is the trivial one. This makes sense considering our definition for linearly independent: if the equation = 0 (i.e if the equation vanishes) then all constant coefficients = 0 (it is trivial) and likewise.
