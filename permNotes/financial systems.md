Set of institutions {banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges} that allows [[funds]] to be exchanged. 

The interactions of a financial system come in three main forms:
1. borrower (someone asking for money with the intent to pay it back)
2. lender (someone giving money and expecting that money plus income back)
3. investor (someone that supplies capital in exchange for profits)

With regards to [[Market Efficiency]], a good set of financial institutions allows people to engage in more transactions due to the ability to borrow as well as improve the performances of businesses since they are incentivised by investments. By squeezing more transactions out of people as well as increasing the inputs of production via capital, the market is increasing both demand and supply.
