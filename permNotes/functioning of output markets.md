Opposite to an [[input market]]. While input markets deal with the input of a [[black box]], output markets deal with the output of a [[black box]]. After a factor has taken its factors of inputs and created its goods and services, the output market is where those specific goods and services are sold. 

Therefore, in the case of [[Market Efficiency]], the functioning of the output market is referring to the ease, security and efficiency of buying and selling goods in the market. If it is easy, safe and efficient to buy and sell goods in the market, then we say the output market is functioning well and that the market is being efficient.
