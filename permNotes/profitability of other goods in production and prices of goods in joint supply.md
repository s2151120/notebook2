Kind of like the [[substitution effect]] for demand.

In a similar vein, if good $A$ is more profitable than good $B$ you will allocate your resources in such a way that you produce more of good $A$ so that you make more profit. Therefore the quantity supplied of good $B$ decreases.

[[Formalising the subsitution effect and its supply equivalent]]

When thinking about [[goods in joint supply]] we notice that the effect is actually opposite to the effect of the profitability of other goods in joint supply.
