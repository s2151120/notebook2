A list of assumptions about human behavior. 

These are the sets of assumptions made about people's buying decisions:

1. buyers are rational
2. more is preferred to less (monotonicity)
3. buyers seek to maximise utility
4. consumers act in self interest and do not consider the utility of others.

Value -> utility of a good / [[willingness to pay]]
