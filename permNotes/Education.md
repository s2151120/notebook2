Education leads to [[Innovation]]. The knowledge brought by [[Innovation]] is then disseminated by education.

Strong basic education (primary and secondary) as well as decent specialisation (tertiary) are important for economic growth. 

Education can be quantified when assessing either the quantity or quality.
Quantifying quality: number of schooling years, pass rate, completion rate
Quantifying quantity: literacy rate, % of population with a degree etc.

**Education is the mechanism for generating innovation and then employing it.**
