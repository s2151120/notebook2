How does money flow?
Firms sell a good in the market. Household buys it. This provides the firm with income. Firm uses this income to buy factors of production such as labour, land and capital from households. The income of the household, the revenue of the firms are all part of GDP. 

GDP = National Expenditure = National Income.

It's all a closed loop. Two people live in a country and there is a transaction of 5 dollars. The country has spend 5 dollars but has also made 5 dollars. 

Mathematically: 

GDP = C + I + G + NX

Where C = consumer spending, I = investment spending, G = government spending and NX = net export. 

GDP does not take into account illegal work, cash work that isn't reported to authorities and work that provides economic benefit to society but isn't productive [[Feminist Critiques of Labour Theory]] i.e the role of the housewife.

Final Good vs Intermediary:

Kind of like living and dead labour in [[Marxist Labour Theory]] but more on consumer items. The final good is the good that consumers purchase. The intermediate good is the good that firms purchase before production. 

Breaking down GDP into its components:

[[Consumption]]

[[Investment]]

[[Government Spending]]

[[Net Exports]]

## Real vs. Nominal GDP

Real = actual increase in production.

Nominal = goods being sold at higher prices but no changes in production. 

GDP Deflator = Nominal GDP/Real GDP x 100
