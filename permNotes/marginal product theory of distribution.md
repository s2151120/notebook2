Assumptions based on: [[Assumptions under the competitive market model]]

## Demand for Labour:
-> derived demand = demand for a factor of production
This is because labour is a *tool* to use in order to produce a good

If labour is a derived demand, that is the same way as saying that the demand for labour is dependent on the demand to supply a particular good to a market. 

For example, the demand for miners would increase if the demand to supply copper increases. 

The efficacy of labour can be seen by the [[production function]]

[[Value of marginal product of input]]

[[Input demand and Output supply]]

[[What causes the labour demand curve to shift?]]

## Supply of Labour

When we enter the work force, we have to do a [[trade-off between consumption and leisure]]

## Equilibrium
Occurs when wage = value of marginal product of labour.
