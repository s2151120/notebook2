If [[Market Efficiency]] is all about the efficiency of the allocation of resources in any given market and [[Education]] is about conditioning [[Innovation]] to create technologies that allow for better efficiency of the allocation of resources then it follows that the driving motivator for innovation is market efficiency. 

It also means that, since market efficiency is about the maximisation of profitable businesses and minimisation of unprofitable businesses, businesses that are unable to adopt profitable technologies will lag behind and ultimately be ejected out of the [[Market]]whereas businesses that are quick to adopt such technologies will get ahead.
