This is useful when looking at demands of different geographical units or comparing demand graphs over time in a changing demographic.

Since we define market demand to be the aggregation of individual demand, if there are more individuals, there is more individual demand and there is a higher market demand overall.

Individuals are stratified belonging to several different groups. This is when the [[structure of a population]] comes into play. Since certain goods are relevant for certain people (i.e hearing aids for old people) the structure of a population would determine the demand for that particular good since there would more more individuals thus more market demand.
