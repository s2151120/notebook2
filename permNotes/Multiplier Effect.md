Marginal Propensity to Consume = MPC = % of income spent on spending. 

Multiplier = decimal form of MPC

Total Output = $x*(\frac{1}{1-m})$
Where $x =$ initial injection of money
and $m =$ multiplier

So this asks the question: if you spend an extra dollar in this economy, what would be its ripple effect on GDP (total output).
