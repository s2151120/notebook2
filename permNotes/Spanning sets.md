What does **span** *actually mean*?
[[Span]]

Considering the definition for [[linear combination]]

The span of two non-zero, non-parallel vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $w, v$ trace out a plane as a result of their [[Span]]. Some point $p$ on the plane that takes the value $(x, y, z)$ can be described as a [[linear combination]] of $w, v$ or the span of $w, v$.

Using the [[Writing equations in set theory notation.]] we can write the plane $M$ as the span of $w, v$ as:

$M = \{av + bw | a, b \in \mathbb{R} \}$

Which implies  that any $p$ orthogonal to $v x w$ must be a linear combination of $p = av + bw$.

[[Proof that if p.vxw = 0, p is a linear combination of v and w.]]

This all ultimately cultivates to: [[Span Theorem]]
