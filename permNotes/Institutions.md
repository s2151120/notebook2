Institutions come in the form of [[financial systems]] , [[Regulatory Framework]] and [[Education]]. An institution is an organisation with a specific purpose be it:

1. religious
2. educational
3. professional
4. social

and can be seen as the mechanism for the country's politics. To have a political opposition is to be in some way opposed to the incumbent institutions, whether at the fundamental level or higher up. 

The point of public institutions is to provide stability because stability is good for trade.
