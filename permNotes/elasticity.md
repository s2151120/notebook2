When looking at elasticity, we change the price and see the reaction in quantity demanded/supplied.

Factors that affect price elasticity:

1. whether the good is a luxury or a necessity (necessities tend to be price inelastic)
2. if the good has a lot of substitutes (tends to be price elastic (eggs vs butter))
3. boundaries of the market (food is price inelastic vs vanilla ice cream is price elastic)
4. the higher the proportion of income devoted to the good, the more price elastic it is (10% change in ice cream vs 10% change in sofa)

$d_e = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta p}$

Where $d_e =$ price elasticity of demand
			$q =$ percentage change in quantity demanded
			$p =$ percentage change in price

However if we have some $Q_1$ and some $Q_2$ then we can either say the quantity fell from $Q_2$ to $Q_1$ or that it increased from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$. So either it is $\frac{Q_1}{Q_2}$ or $\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}$.

To fix this, we can say that $d_e = \frac{(Q_2 - Q_1)/(Q_2 + Q_1)/2}{(P_2 - P_1)/(P_2+P_1)/2}$. This is the midpoint technique. 

			
Taking this further, we are essentially dividing the $x$ value by the $y$ value so we're finding the reciprocal of the slope of a demand curve in order to calculate price elasticity.

What if we don't have two points?
Then we have to look at [[point price elasticity]]
