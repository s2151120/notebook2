Cost of Living can be measured like this: Take the cost of one good in one year, take the cost of the same good the next year, then divide the cost of that good by the first year's cost. 

Issues:

Substitution:
[[substitution effect]] As the price of goods rise the demand for its cheaper substitutes will rise. So if consumers are substituting with cheaper goods then their cost of living is not increasing. 

New goods:
Sometimes new goods are introduced which represent cheaper alternatives and are substituted. 

Unmeasured Quality Change

Relevance of CPI:
Irrelevant depending on the spending pattern of individuals.

Differences between CPI and GDP deflator in [[GDP]]:
CPI measures consumer inflation whereas GDP deflator measures inflation as a whole, for example military spending following an increase in price of ammunition.
