Substitution effect and profitability of other goods in production are virtually equivalents in demand and supply respectively. We can make this concept more abstract:

If some good $X$ gives more utility than some good $Y$ you will $Z$ more of $X$ and less of $Y$.

where

$Z$ is (produce, consume) depending if you are a producer or consumer.

Utility can be defined with price but it is `price`$\times (-1)$ if you are a consumer and `price` if you are a producer.
